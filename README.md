This is a simple plugin that can be installed into the Avior service backend. 
Use it as a template to build your own Avior plugins!
An Avior plugin contains the necessary files for the API to connect with the SDN controller,
and the front-end files to show data in the GUI.
The folder is then zipped to .zip format and uploaded to Avior where it will be integrated seamlessly upon restart.

Helpful tools for building Avior plugins:

 * 1.) This template and the comments therein
 * 2.) The documentation at http://sailsjs.org/ for the backend API
 * 3.) The documentation at http://backbonejs.org/ for the frontend GUI
 * 4.) Some experience with a selection of Javascript/JSON/node.js/HTML
 * 5.) Knowledge of the Floodlight and/or OpenDaylight SDN controllers and their REST APIs

Feel free to set up an issue on this repository with your questions.
